Authentication: Proper authentication is a hugely important concern in modern web applications. 
I will be exploring the Auth0 library. 

Prepare a demo of Auth0 or a similar library, showing how developers can get started with the library, 
along with identity management and important features such as single sign-on.

The submission of the assignment is as follows:
- The main branch of your GitHub repo, as of the due date on this Canvas assignment page, will serve as your code submission.
- DO NOT commit your node_modules folder, or any build files. These should be appropriately .gitignore'd. 
  Failure to adhere to this instruction will result in an automatic 50% penalty for the assignment.
- You must submit a single video file containing your presentation to this Canvas assignment page, on or before its due date.
- You must submit your peer review via Google Form, within three weeks from the initial assignment due date.
